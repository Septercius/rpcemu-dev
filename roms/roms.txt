This directory needs to contain the RISC OS ROMs.  All files that don't
start with a "." or have the extension "txt" will be joined together in
alphabetical order to make up the ROM that RPCEmu uses.  The total
length of the ROM files must be 2, 4, 6, or 8MiB long.

Please see the website for more information on compatibility and
ROM sources.
