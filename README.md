This is a development repository for **RPCEmu**, an Acorn RISC PC emulator for Windows, Mac and Linux.  It is intended for use in developing and testing patches before they are submitted to the mailing list for inclusion in the original source tree.

The home page for RPCEmu can be found here: http://www.marutan.net/rpcemu/index.php.  Here you can find a user guide and information on how to set up networking.

Binaries can be found in the "Releases" page, and are distributed as DMGs.  To use a DMG, download and double-click to open.  Inside each can be found an interpreter and recompiler build (most people will want the latter).  In addition, there is a "Data" folder containing the basic files you need to get the emulator up and running.  To this you will need to add a RISC OS ROM, such as the IOMD images found on the RISC OS Open web site.

Copy the "Data" folder somewhere suitable, such as in your "Documents" folder, and if required give it an appropriate name.  Then run your binary of choice.  If this is the first time you have used one of these releases, you will be prompted to choose the location of the "Data" folder.  Click on the "Select" button and navigate to the appropriate location (you need to choose the folder itself, not its parent). Finally, press the "OK" button and the emulator should boot.
